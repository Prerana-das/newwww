									<h3>Well-prepared college application = a short cut in tuition assistance</h3>

									<p>You will receive many scholarship inquiries. I can always get good financial aid if I prepare and submit a college application. The reason is simple. Many scholarships are transferring scholarship funds to universities. The scholarship foundation concluded that selecting a college is more effective than deciding on a scholarship recipient. In addition, the Scholarship Foundation may spend a lot of time and money in determining the scholarship recipient, and often the beneficiaries do not appear.</p>

									</p>80% of scholarships are awarded to college-bound students through college. The selection criteria are determined by the applications submitted by the students.</p>

									<p>Being able to prepare for an application can benefit from the benefits of getting a lot of financial aid.</p>

									<p>First, you need to be careful with your application. There should never be grammatical errors. Accurate and sincere preparations provide admissions officers with confidence in their students. There are a lot of grammatical errors, and if you answer questions without gender, you can not get very good results. Some appraisers say they can immediately see who will succeed if they look at the application.</p>

									<p>Second, write your answers with care in the questions asked by the application. Of course, not long. However, it is possible to give more accurate information about the students themselves by understanding the questions accurately and by giving answers. It does not mean that you can not know all of your students with your SAT scores. Rather, college applications and essays give students a better understanding. When filling in an application's space, you should concentrate and do your best to write down the best answer. You may be given only one chance in your life. Should not you try your best?</p>

									<p>Third, the service, leadership, and specialty activities that he or she has done in and out of school need to be detailed and well documented. Some students have talent in music and win a competition. Some students are notoriously good, but steadily serve in nursing home. These two cases can not be evaluated absolutely. The service of the second student is more valuable to the student and more appealing to the admissions officer. I recently completed high school in SAT</p>

									<p>I graduated and had excellent piano skills, so I played in front of the president and thought it was great, but I did not even admit it at one Ivy League school. It is a sad thing to me and these things happen. The reason is simple. This is because this student was not the student who wanted in college. I think the cause is in the application that the student created. Each university has a standard for selecting students and a student awards the university wants. Before you write an application, I recommend you check out the university's website to see and understand the mission. Interviewing should be a situation that naturally emphasizes the school's mission and that you are the right person for it.</p>

									<p>This October, we want our 12th grade students to think about writing applications as part of their life design and work hard really hard. I remember what my colleagues have always said.</p>

									<p>"Hard work pays off!" If you try hard, you will bear fruit.</p>
